## CVE-2025-41068
 Reachable Assertion vulnerability in Open5GS up to version 2.7.6 allows attackers with connectivity to the NRF to cause a denial of service. This is achieved by sending the creation of an NF with an invalid type via SBI and then requesting its data. The NRF executes a check that crashes the process, leaving the discovery service unresponsive.

## CVE-2025-41067
 Reachable Assertion vulnerability in Open5GS up to version 2.7.6 allows attackers with connectivity to the NRF to cause a denial of service. An SBI request that deletes the NRF's own registry causes a check that ends up crashing the NRF process and renders the discovery service unavailable.

## CVE-2025-32433
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2022-29800
 A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because there is a certain time between the scripts being discovered and them being run. An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to replace scripts that networkd-dispatcher believes to be owned by root with ones that are not.

## CVE-2022-29799
 A vulnerability was found in networkd-dispatcher. This flaw exists because no functions are sanitized by the OperationalState or the AdministrativeState of networkd-dispatcher. This attack leads to a directory traversal to escape from the “/etc/networkd-dispatcher” base directory.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-21344
 XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.

## CVE-2021-4374
 The WordPress Automatic Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary options updates in versions up to, and including, 3.53.2. This is due to missing authorization and option validation in the process_form.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily update the settings of a vulnerable site and ultimately compromise the entire site.

## CVE-2021-4034
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

## CVE-2018-25031
 Swagger UI 4.1.2 and earlier could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks. By persuading a victim to open a crafted URL, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to display remote OpenAPI definitions. Note: This was originally claimed to be resolved in 4.1.3. However, third parties have indicated this is not resolved in 4.1.3 and even occurs in that version and possibly others.
