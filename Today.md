## CVE-2025-62168
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.

## CVE-2025-59528
 Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-11174
 The Document Library Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Improper Authorization in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6. This is due to the plugin exposing an unauthenticated AJAX action dll_load_posts which returns a JSON table of document data without performing nonce or capability checks. The handler accepts an attacker-controlled args array where the status option explicitly allows draft, pending, future, and any. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve unpublished document titles and content via the AJAX endpoint.

## CVE-2025-11171
 The Chartify – WordPress Chart Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authentication for Critical Function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.9. This is due to the plugin registering an unauthenticated AJAX action that dispatches to admin-class methods based on a request parameter, without any nonce or capability checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute administrative functions via the wp-admin/admin-ajax.php endpoint granted they can identify callable method names.

## CVE-2025-2011
 The Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to generic SQL Injection via the ‘s' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.

## CVE-2022-22965
 A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.

## CVE-2022-22947
 In spring cloud gateway versions prior to 3.1.1+ and 3.0.7+ , applications are vulnerable to a code injection attack when the Gateway Actuator endpoint is enabled, exposed and unsecured. A remote attacker could make a maliciously crafted request that could allow arbitrary remote execution on the remote host.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
