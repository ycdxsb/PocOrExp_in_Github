# Update 2026-02-13
## CVE-2026-21858
 n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Versions starting with 1.65.0 and below 1.121.0 enable an attacker to access files on the underlying server through execution of certain form-based workflows. A vulnerable workflow could grant access to an unauthenticated remote attacker, resulting in exposure of sensitive information stored on the system and may enable further compromise depending on deployment configuration and workflow usage. This issue is fixed in version 1.121.0.

## CVE-2026-2249
 METIS DFS devices (versions = oscore 2.1.234-r18) expose a web-based shell at the /console endpoint that does not require authentication. Accessing this endpoint allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with 'daemon' privileges. This results in the compromise of the software, granting unauthorized access to modify configuration, read and alter sensitive data, or disrupt services.

## CVE-2026-1560
 The Custom Block Builder – Lazy Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.0 via multiple functions in the 'LazyBlocks_Blocks' class. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute code on the server.

## CVE-2026-1529
 A flaw was found in Keycloak. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by modifying the organization ID and target email within a legitimate invitation token's JSON Web Token (JWT) payload. This lack of cryptographic signature verification allows the attacker to successfully self-register into an unauthorized organization, leading to unauthorized access.

## CVE-2026-1357
 The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to and including 0.9.123. This is due to improper error handling in the RSA decryption process combined with a lack of path sanitization when writing uploaded files. When the plugin fails to decrypt a session key using openssl_private_decrypt(), it does not terminate execution and instead passes the boolean false value to the phpseclib library's AES cipher initialization. The library treats this false value as a string of null bytes, allowing an attacker to encrypt a malicious payload using a predictable null-byte key. Additionally, the plugin accepts filenames from the decrypted payload without sanitization, enabling directory traversal to escape the protected backup directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to publicly accessible directories and achieve Remote Code Execution via the wpvivid_action=send_to_site parameter.

## CVE-2025-49132
 Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.11.11, using the /locales/locale.json with the locale and namespace query parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code without being authenticated. With the ability to execute arbitrary code it could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from the Panel's config, extract sensitive information from the database, access files of servers managed by the panel, etc. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.11. There are no software workarounds for this vulnerability, but use of an external Web Application Firewall (WAF) could help mitigate this attack.

## CVE-2025-32433
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-5701
 The HyperComments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the hc_request_handler function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.

## CVE-2025-5394
 The Alone – Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a missing capability check on the alone_import_pack_install_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload zip files containing webshells disguised as plugins from remote locations to achieve remote code execution.

## CVE-2025-4606
 The Sala - Startup & SaaS WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.4. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.

## CVE-2022-22965
 A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
