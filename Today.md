## CVE-2025-56311
 In Shenzhen C-Data Technology Co. FD602GW-DX-R410 (firmware v2.2.14), the web management interface contains an authenticated CSRF vulnerability on the reboot endpoint (/boaform/admin/formReboot). An attacker can craft a malicious webpage that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, causes the router to reboot without explicit user consent. This lack of CSRF protection on a sensitive administrative function can lead to denial of service by disrupting network availability.

## CVE-2025-54424
 1Panel is a web interface and MCP Server that manages websites, files, containers, databases, and LLMs on a Linux server. In versions 2.0.5 and below, the HTTPS protocol used for communication between the Core and Agent endpoints has incomplete certificate verification during certificate validation, leading to unauthorized interface access. Due to the presence of numerous command execution or high-privilege interfaces in 1Panel, this results in Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is fixed in version 2.0.6. The CVE has been translated from Simplified Chinese using GitHub Copilot.

## CVE-2025-51005
 A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the tcpliveplay utility of the tcpreplay-4.5.1. When a crafted pcap file is processed, the program incorrectly handles memory in the checksum calculation logic at do_checksum_math_liveplay in tcpliveplay.c, leading to a possible denial of service.

## CVE-2025-48384
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

## CVE-2025-34100
 An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in BuilderEngine 3.5.0 via the integration of the elFinder 2.0 file manager and its use of the jQuery File Upload plugin. The plugin fails to properly validate or restrict file types or locations during upload operations, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious .php file and subsequently execute arbitrary PHP code on the server under the context of the web server process. While the root vulnerability lies within the jQuery File Upload component, BuilderEngine’s improper integration and lack of access controls expose this functionality to unauthenticated users, resulting in full remote code execution.

## CVE-2025-32432
 Craft is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond. Starting from version 3.0.0-RC1 to before 3.9.15, 4.0.0-RC1 to before 4.14.15, and 5.0.0-RC1 to before 5.6.17, Craft is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is a high-impact, low-complexity attack vector. This issue has been patched in versions 3.9.15, 4.14.15, and 5.6.17, and is an additional fix for CVE-2023-41892.

## CVE-2025-30406
 Gladinet CentreStack through 16.1.10296.56315 (fixed in 16.4.10315.56368) has a deserialization vulnerability due to the CentreStack portal's hardcoded machineKey use, as exploited in the wild in March 2025. This enables threat actors (who know the machineKey) to serialize a payload for server-side deserialization to achieve remote code execution. NOTE: a CentreStack admin can manually delete the machineKey defined in portal\web.config.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2024-4577
 In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use "Best-Fit" behavior to replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc.

## CVE-2023-6933
 The Better Search Replace plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.4 via deserialization of untrusted input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

## CVE-2020-3452
 A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.
