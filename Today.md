## CVE-2025-64328
 FreePBX Endpoint Manager is a module for managing telephony endpoints in FreePBX systems. In versions 17.0.2.36 and above before 17.0.3, the filestore module within the Administrative interface is vulnerable to a post-authentication command injection by an authenticated known user via the testconnection - check_ssh_connect() function. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to obtain remote access to the system as an asterisk user. This issue is fixed in version 17.0.3.

## CVE-2025-62507
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions 8.2.0 and above, a user can run the XACKDEL command with multiple ID's and trigger a stack buffer overflow, which may potentially lead to remote code execution. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.3. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing XACKDEL operation. This can be done using ACL to restrict XACKDEL command.

## CVE-2025-62369
 Xibo is an open source digital signage platform with a web content management system (CMS). Versions 4.3.0 and below contain a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the CMS Developer menu's Module Templating functionality, allowing authenticated users with "System - Add/Edit custom modules and templates" permissions to manipulate Twig filters and execute arbitrary server-side functions as the web server user. This issue is fixed in version 4.3.1. To workaround this issue, use the 4.1 and 4.2 patch commits.

## CVE-2024-38355
 Socket.IO is an open source, real-time, bidirectional, event-based, communication framework. A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the "error" event to catch these errors.

## CVE-2023-2916
 The InfiniteWP Client plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.11.1 via the 'admin_notice' function. This can allow authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to extract sensitive data including configuration. It can only be exploited if the plugin has not been configured yet. If combined with another arbitrary plugin installation and activation vulnerability, it may be possible to connect a site to InfiniteWP which would make remote management possible and allow for elevation of privileges.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
