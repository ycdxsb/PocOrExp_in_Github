## CVE-2025-49844
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 8.2.1 and below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector, trigger a use-after-free and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-22964
 DDSN Interactive cm3 Acora CMS version 10.1.1 has an unauthenticated time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability caused by insufficient input sanitization and validation in the "table" parameter. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries by directly incorporating user-supplied input into database queries without proper escaping or validation. Exploiting this issue enables unauthorized access, manipulation of data, or exposure of sensitive information, posing significant risks to the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

## CVE-2025-22953
 A SQL injection vulnerability exists in Epicor HCM 2021 1.9, with patches available: 5.16.0.1033/HCM2022, 5.17.0.1146/HCM2023, and 5.18.0.573/HCM2024. The injection is specifically in the filter parameter of the JsonFetcher.svc endpoint. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL payloads into the filter parameter, enabling the unauthorized execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database. If certain features (like xp_cmdshell) are enabled, this may lead to remote code execution.

## CVE-2025-22620
 gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Prior to 0.17.0, gix-worktree-state specifies 0777 permissions when checking out executable files, intending that the umask will restrict them appropriately. But one of the strategies it uses to set permissions is not subject to the umask. This causes files in a repository to be world-writable in some situations. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.0.

## CVE-2024-45496
 A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.
