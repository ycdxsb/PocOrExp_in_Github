## CVE-2025-51411
 A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Institute-of-Current-Students v1.0 via the email parameter in the /postquerypublic endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before reflecting it in the HTML response. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by tricking them into visiting a crafted URL or submitting a malicious form. Successful exploitation may lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other client-side attacks.

## CVE-2025-29927
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-6382
 The Taeggie Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's taeggie-feed shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.10. The plugin’s render() method takes the user-supplied name attribute and injects it directly into a script tag - both in the id attribute and inside jQuery.getScript() - without proper escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## CVE-2023-38831
 RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October 2023.

## CVE-2023-33177
 Xibo is a content management system (CMS). A path traversal vulnerability exists in the Xibo CMS whereby a specially crafted zip file can be uploaded to the CMS via the layout import function by an authenticated user which would allow creation of files outside of the CMS library directory as the webserver user. This can be used to upload a PHP webshell inside the web root directory and achieve remote code execution as the webserver user. Users should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. Customers who host their CMS with Xibo Signage have already received an upgrade or patch to resolve this issue regardless of the CMS version that they are running.

## CVE-2023-2745
 WordPress Core is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 6.2, via the ‘wp_lang’ parameter. This allows unauthenticated attackers to access and load arbitrary translation files. In cases where an attacker is able to upload a crafted translation file onto the site, such as via an upload form, this could be also used to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

## CVE-2022-39299
 Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication library. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround.

## CVE-2022-31199
 Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the Netwrix Auditor User Activity Video Recording component affecting both the Netwrix Auditor server and agents installed on monitored systems.

## CVE-2020-12446
 The ene.sys driver in G.SKILL Trident Z Lighting Control through 1.00.08 exposes mapping and un-mapping of physical memory, reading and writing to Model Specific Register (MSR) registers, and input from and output to I/O ports to local non-privileged users. This leads to privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

## CVE-2019-13272
 In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.

## CVE-2019-9193
 In PostgreSQL 9.3 through 11.2, the "COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM" function allows superusers and users in the 'pg_execute_server_program' group to execute arbitrary code in the context of the database's operating system user. This functionality is enabled by default and can be abused to run arbitrary operating system commands on Windows, Linux, and macOS. NOTE: Third parties claim/state this is not an issue because PostgreSQL functionality for ‘COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM’ is acting as intended. References state that in PostgreSQL, a superuser can execute commands as the server user without using the ‘COPY FROM PROGRAM’.
