## CVE-2025-62726
 n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to 1.113.0, a remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Git Node component available in both Cloud and Self-Hosted versions of n8n. When a malicious actor clones a remote repository containing a pre-commit hook, the subsequent use of the Commit operation in the Git Node can inadvertently trigger the hook’s execution. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code within the n8n environment, potentially compromising the system and any connected credentials or workflows. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.113.0.

## CVE-2025-24893
 XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any guest can perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to `SolrSearch`. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. To reproduce on an instance, without being logged in, go to `host/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch?media=rss&text=%7D%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28"Hello%20from"%20%2B%20"%20search%20text%3A"%20%2B%20%2823%20%2B%2019%29%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D%20`. If there is an output, and the title of the RSS feed contains `Hello from search text:42`, then the instance is vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1 and 16.5.0RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may edit `Main.SolrSearchMacros` in `SolrSearchMacros.xml` on line 955 to match the `rawResponse` macro in `macros.vm#L2824` with a content type of `application/xml`, instead of simply outputting the content of the feed.

## CVE-2025-11833
 The Post SMTP – Complete SMTP Solution with Logs, Alerts, Backup SMTP & Mobile App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the __construct function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary logged emails sent through the Post SMTP plugin, including password reset emails containing password reset links, which can lead to account takeover.

## CVE-2025-5939
 The Telegram for WP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

## CVE-2024-32019
 Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
