## CVE-2025-64513
 Milvus is an open-source vector database built for generative AI applications. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5 to bypass all authentication mechanisms in the Milvus Proxy component, gaining full administrative access to the Milvus cluster. This grants the attacker the ability to read, modify, or delete data, and to perform privileged administrative operations such as database or collection management. This issue has been fixed in Milvus 2.4.24, 2.5.21, and 2.6.5. If immediate upgrade is not possible, a temporary mitigation can be applied by removing the sourceID header from all incoming requests at the gateway, API gateway, or load balancer level before they reach the Milvus Proxy. This prevents attackers from exploiting the authentication bypass behavior.

## CVE-2025-64500
 Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.

## CVE-2025-64495
 Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. In versions 0.6.34 and below, the functionality that inserts custom prompts into the chat window is vulnerable to DOM XSS when 'Insert Prompt as Rich Text' is enabled, since the prompt body is assigned to the DOM sink .innerHtml without sanitisation. Any user with permissions to create prompts can abuse this to plant a payload that could be triggered by other users if they run the corresponding / command to insert the prompt. This issue is fixed in version 0.6.35.

## CVE-2025-62518
 astral-tokio-tar is a tar archive reading/writing library for async Rust. Versions of astral-tokio-tar prior to 0.5.6 contain a boundary parsing vulnerability that allows attackers to smuggle additional archive entries by exploiting inconsistent PAX/ustar header handling. When processing archives with PAX-extended headers containing size overrides, the parser incorrectly advances stream position based on ustar header size (often zero) instead of the PAX-specified size, causing it to interpret file content as legitimate tar headers. This issue has been patched in version 0.5.6. There are no workarounds.

## CVE-2025-62506
 MinIO is a high-performance object storage system. In all versions prior to RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z, a privilege escalation vulnerability allows service accounts and STS (Security Token Service) accounts with restricted session policies to bypass their inline policy restrictions when performing operations on their own account, specifically when creating new service accounts for the same user. The vulnerability exists in the IAM policy validation logic where the code incorrectly relied on the DenyOnly argument when validating session policies for restricted accounts. When a session policy is present, the system should validate that the action is allowed by the session policy, not just that it is not denied. An attacker with valid credentials for a restricted service or STS account can create a new service account for itself without policy restrictions, resulting in a new service account with full parent privileges instead of being restricted by the inline policy. This allows the attacker to access buckets and objects beyond their intended restrictions and modify, delete, or create objects outside their authorized scope. The vulnerability is fixed in version RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z.

## CVE-2025-62410
 In versions before 20.0.2, it was found that --disallow-code-generation-from-strings is not sufficient for isolating untrusted JavaScript in happy-dom. The untrusted script and the rest of the application still run in the same Isolate/process, so attackers can deploy prototype pollution payloads to hijack important references like "process" in the example below, or to hijack control flow via flipping checks of undefined property. This vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-61927. The vulnerability is fixed in 20.0.2.

## CVE-2025-62376
 pwn.college DOJO is an education platform for learning cybersecurity. In versions up to and including commit 781d91157cfc234a434d0bab45cbcf97894c642e, the /workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization. The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source URL that grants full access to the target user's Windows VM. This impacts all users with active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive. This issue has been patched in commit 467db0b9ea0d9a929dc89b41f6eb59f7cfc68bef. No known workarounds exist.

## CVE-2025-62168
 Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.

## CVE-2025-61777
 Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.3.2, the `/api/admin/badge-templates` (GET) and `/api/admin/badge-templates/create` (POST) endpoints previously allowed access without authentication or authorization. This could have enabled unauthorized users to retrieve all badge templates and sensitive metadata (createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt) and/or create arbitrary badge templates in the database. This could lead to data exposure, database pollution, or abuse of the badge system. The issue has been fixed in FlagForge v2.3.2. GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE endpoints now require authentication. Authorization checks ensure only admins can access and modify badge templates. No reliable workarounds are available.

## CVE-2025-61622
 Deserialization of untrusted data in python in pyfory versions 0.12.0 through 0.12.2, or the legacy pyfury versions from 0.1.0 through 0.10.3: allows arbitrary code execution. An application is vulnerable if it reads pyfory serialized data from untrusted sources. An attacker can craft a data stream that selects pickle-fallback serializer during deserialization, leading to the execution of `pickle.loads`, which is vulnerable to remote code execution.

Users are recommended to upgrade to pyfory version 0.12.3 or later, which has removed pickle fallback serializer and thus fixes this issue.

## CVE-2025-59934
 Formbricks is an open source qualtrics alternative. Prior to version 4.0.1, Formbricks is missing JWT signature verification. This vulnerability stems from a token validation routine that only decodes JWTs (jwt.decode) without verifying their signatures. Both the email verification token login path and the password reset server action use the same validator, which does not check the token’s signature, expiration, issuer, or audience. If an attacker learns the victim’s actual user.id, they can craft an arbitrary JWT with an alg: "none" header and use it to authenticate and reset the victim’s password. This issue has been patched in version 4.0.1.

## CVE-2025-59528
 Flowise is a drag & drop user interface to build a customized large language model flow. In version 3.0.5, Flowise is vulnerable to remote code execution. The CustomMCP node allows users to input configuration settings for connecting to an external MCP server. This node parses the user-provided mcpServerConfig string to build the MCP server configuration. However, during this process, it executes JavaScript code without any security validation. Specifically, inside the convertToValidJSONString function, user input is directly passed to the Function() constructor, which evaluates and executes the input as JavaScript code. Since this runs with full Node.js runtime privileges, it can access dangerous modules such as child_process and fs. This issue has been patched in version 3.0.6.

## CVE-2025-59489
 Unity Runtime before 2025-10-02 on Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux allows argument injection that can result in loading of library code from an unintended location. If an application was built with a version of Unity Editor that had the vulnerable Unity Runtime code, then an adversary may be able to execute code on, and exfiltrate confidential information from, the machine on which that application is running. NOTE: product status is provided for Unity Editor because that is the information available from the Supplier. However, updating Unity Editor typically does not address the effects of the vulnerability; instead, it is necessary to rebuild and redeploy all affected applications.

## CVE-2025-59424
 LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. Prior to 2.3.1, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified on the /system/audit page. The application fails to properly sanitize the username field before it is rendered in the audit log. An authenticated attacker can set a malicious JavaScript payload as their username. When an action performed by this user is recorded (e.g., generate or revoke an API token), the payload is stored in the database. The script is then executed in the browser of any user, particularly administrators, who views the /system/audit page. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.1.

## CVE-2025-59342
 esm.sh is a nobuild content delivery network(CDN) for modern web development. In 136 and earlier, a path-traversal flaw in the handling of the X-Zone-Id HTTP header allows an attacker to cause the application to write files outside the intended storage location. The header value is used to build a filesystem path but is not properly canonicalized or restricted to the application’s storage base directory. As a result, supplying ../ sequences in X-Zone-Id causes files to be written to arbitrary directories.

## CVE-2025-58180
 OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.11.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker to upload a file under a specially crafted filename that will allow arbitrary command execution if said filename becomes included in a command defined in a system event handler and said event gets triggered. If no event handlers executing system commands with uploaded filenames as parameters have been configured, this vulnerability does not have an impact. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.11.3. As a workaround, OctoPrint administrators who have event handlers configured that include any kind of filename based placeholders should disable those by setting their `enabled` property to `False` or unchecking the "Enabled" checkbox in the GUI based Event Manager. Alternatively, OctoPrint administrators should set `feature.enforceReallyUniversalFilenames` to `true` in `config.yaml` and restart OctoPrint, then vet the existing uploads and make sure to delete any suspicious looking files. As always, OctoPrint administrators are advised to not expose OctoPrint on hostile networks like the public internet, and to vet who has access to their instance.

## CVE-2025-57203
 MagicProject AI version 9.1 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the chatbot generation feature available to authenticated admin users. The vulnerability resides in the prompt parameter submitted to the /dashboard/user/generator/generate-stream endpoint via a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to insufficient input sanitization, attackers can inject HTML-based JavaScript payloads. This payload is stored and rendered unsanitized in subsequent views, leading to execution in other users' browsers when they access affected content. This issue allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of another user, potentially leading to session hijacking, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or administrative account takeover. The application does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) or adequate input filtering to prevent such attacks. A fix should include proper sanitization, output encoding, and strong CSP enforcement to mitigate exploitation.

## CVE-2025-56803
 Figma Desktop for Windows version 125.6.5 contains a command injection vulnerability in the local plugin loader. An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands by setting a crafted build field in the plugin's manifest.json. This field is passed to child_process.exec without validation, leading to possible RCE. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the behavior only allows a local user to attack himself via a local plugin. The local build procedure, which is essential to the attack, is not executed for plugins shared to the Figma Community.

## CVE-2025-56800
 Reolink desktop application 8.18.12 contains a vulnerability in its local authentication mechanism. The application implements lock screen password logic entirely on the client side using JavaScript within an Electron resource file. Because the password is stored and returned via a modifiable JavaScript property(a.settingsManager.lockScreenPassword), an attacker can patch the return value to bypass authentication. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the lock-screen bypass would only occur if the local user modified his own instance of the application.

## CVE-2025-56132
 LiquidFiles filetransfer server is vulnerable to a user enumeration issue in its password reset functionality. The application returns distinguishable responses for valid and invalid email addresses, allowing unauthenticated attackers to determine the existence of user accounts. Version 4.2 introduces user-based lockout mechanisms to mitigate brute-force attacks, user enumeration remains possible by default. In versions prior to 4.2, no such user-level protection is in place, only basic IP-based rate limiting is enforced. This IP-based protection can be bypassed by distributing requests across multiple IPs (e.g., rotating IP or proxies). Effectively bypassing both login and password reset security controls. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to enumerate valid email addresses registered for the application, increasing the risk of follow-up attacks such as password spraying.

## CVE-2025-55752
 Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression where the       rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the       possibility that, for rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the       URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to bypass security       constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI.



This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108.

The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are 
known to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions may also be affected.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45 or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue.

## CVE-2025-54957
 An issue was discovered in Dolby UDC 4.5 through 4.13. A crash of the DD+ decoder process can occur when a malformed DD+ bitstream is processed. When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

## CVE-2025-54887
 jwe is a Ruby implementation of the RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE) standard. In versions 1.1.0 and below, authentication tags of encrypted JWEs can be brute forced, which may result in loss of confidentiality for those JWEs and provide ways to craft arbitrary JWEs. This puts users at risk because JWEs can be modified to decrypt to an arbitrary value, decrypted by observing parsing differences and the GCM internal GHASH key can be recovered. Users are affected by this vulnerability even if they do not use an AES-GCM encryption algorithm for their JWEs. As the GHASH key may have been leaked, users must rotate the encryption keys after upgrading. This issue is fixed in version 1.1.1.

## CVE-2025-54794
 Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. In versions below 0.2.111, a path validation flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical path comparison, makes it possible to bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the CWD. Successful exploitation depends on the presence of (or ability to create) a directory with the same prefix as the CWD and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This is fixed in version 0.2.111.

## CVE-2025-54793
 Astro is a web framework for content-driven websites. In versions 5.2.0 through 5.12.7, there is an Open Redirect vulnerability in the trailing slash redirection logic when handling paths with double slashes. This allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary external domains by crafting URLs such as https://mydomain.com//malicious-site.com/. This increases the risk of phishing and other social engineering attacks. This affects sites that use on-demand rendering (SSR) with the Node or Cloudflare adapters. It does not affect static sites, or sites deployed to Netlify or Vercel. This issue is fixed in version 5.12.8. To work around this issue at the network level, block outgoing redirect responses with a Location header value that starts with `//`.

## CVE-2025-54782
 Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. In versions 0.2.0 and below, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds HTTP endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints, /inspector/graph/interact, accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.

## CVE-2025-54589
 Copyparty is a portable file server. In versions 1.18.6 and below, when accessing the recent uploads page at `/?ru`, users can filter the results using an input field at the top. This field appends a filter parameter to the URL, which reflects its value directly into a `script` block without proper escaping, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can be exploited against both authenticated and unauthenticated users. This is fixed in version 1.18.7.

## CVE-2025-54381
 BentoML is a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI apps and model inference. In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default. Version 1.4.19 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE-2025-54135
 Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions below 1.3.9, If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence, if sensitive MCP files, such as the .cursor/mcp.json file don't already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.

## CVE-2025-53640
 Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7, an endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account, who wish to truly restrict access to these user details, should consider restricting user search to managers. As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.

## CVE-2025-53632
 Chall-Manager is a platform-agnostic system able to start Challenges on Demand of a player. When decoding a scenario (i.e. a zip archive), the path of the file to write is not checked, potentially leading to zip slips. Exploitation does not require authentication nor authorization, so anyone can exploit it. It should nonetheless not be exploitable as it is highly recommended to bury Chall-Manager deep within the infrastructure due to its large capabilities, so no users could reach the system. Patch has been implemented by commit 47d188f and shipped in v0.1.4.

## CVE-2025-53547
 Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.

## CVE-2025-53533
 Pi-hole Admin Interface is a web interface for managing Pi-hole, a network-level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application. Pi-hole Admin Interface versions 6.2.1 and earlier are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) via a malformed URL path. The 404 error page includes the requested path in the class attribute of the body tag without proper sanitization or escaping. An attacker can craft a URL containing an onload attribute that will execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser when a victim visits the malicious link. If an attacker sends a crafted pi-hole link to a victim and the victim visits it, attacker-controlled JavaScript code is executed in the browser of the victim. This has been patched in version 6.3.

## CVE-2025-53367
 DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.

## CVE-2025-52881
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3, and 1.4.0-rc.3.

## CVE-2025-52565
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.

## CVE-2025-51726
 CyberGhostVPNSetup.exe (Windows installer) is signed using the weak cryptographic hash algorithm SHA-1, which is vulnerable to collision attacks. This allows a malicious actor to craft a fake installer with a forged SHA-1 certificate that may still be accepted by Windows signature verification mechanisms, particularly on systems without strict SmartScreen or trust policy enforcement. Additionally, the installer lacks High Entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), as confirmed by BinSkim (BA2015 rule) and repeated WinDbg analysis. The binary consistently loads into predictable memory ranges, increasing the success rate of memory corruption exploits. These two misconfigurations, when combined, significantly lower the bar for successful supply-chain style attacks or privilege escalation through fake installers.

## CVE-2025-50675
 GPMAW 14, a bioinformatics software, has a critical vulnerability related to insecure file permissions in its installation directory. The directory is accessible with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate files within the directory, including executable files like GPMAW3.exe, Fragment.exe, and the uninstaller GPsetup64_17028.exe. An attacker with user-level access can exploit this misconfiguration by replacing or modifying the uninstaller (GPsetup64_17028.exe) with a malicious version. While the application itself runs in the user's context, the uninstaller is typically executed with administrative privileges when an administrator attempts to uninstall the software. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin, resulting in privilege escalation.

## CVE-2025-50472
 The modelscope/ms-swift library thru 2.6.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_model_meta()` function of the `ModelFileSystemCache()` class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.

## CVE-2025-50461
 A deserialization vulnerability exists in Volcengine's verl 3.0.0, specifically in the scripts/model_merger.py script when using the "fsdp" backend. The script calls torch.load() with weights_only=False on user-supplied .pt files, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted model file is loaded. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a victim to download and place a malicious model file in a local directory with a specific filename pattern. This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the script.

## CVE-2025-50460
 A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the ms-swift project version 3.3.0 due to unsafe deserialization in tests/run.py using yaml.load() from the PyYAML library (versions = 5.3.1). If an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration file passed to the --run_config parameter, arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization. This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML file is loaded, allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher, and to use yaml.safe_load() to mitigate the issue.

## CVE-2025-50340
 An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in SOGo Webmail thru 5.6.0, allowing an authenticated user to send emails on behalf of other users by manipulating a user-controlled identifier in the email-sending request. The server fails to verify whether the authenticated user is authorized to use the specified sender identity, resulting in unauthorized message delivery as another user. This can lead to impersonation, phishing, or unauthorized communication within the system. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because the only effective way to prevent this sender spoofing is on the SMTP server, not within a client such as SOGo.

## CVE-2025-49844
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 8.2.1 and below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted Lua script to manipulate the garbage collector, trigger a use-after-free and potentially lead to remote code execution. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA commands.

## CVE-2025-49144
 Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor. In versions 8.8.1 and prior, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Notepad++ v8.8.1 installer that allows unprivileged users to gain SYSTEM-level privileges through insecure executable search paths. An attacker could use social engineering or clickjacking to trick users into downloading both the legitimate installer and a malicious executable to the same directory (typically Downloads folder - which is known as Vulnerable directory). Upon running the installer, the attack executes automatically with SYSTEM privileges. This issue has been fixed and will be released in version 8.8.2.

## CVE-2025-49132
 Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.11.11, using the /locales/locale.json with the locale and namespace query parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code without being authenticated. With the ability to execute arbitrary code it could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from the Panel's config, extract sensitive information from the database, access files of servers managed by the panel, etc. This issue has been patched in version 1.11.11. There are no software workarounds for this vulnerability, but use of an external Web Application Firewall (WAF) could help mitigate this attack.

## CVE-2025-49125
 Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.  When using PreResources or PostResources mounted other than at the root of the web application, it was possible to access those resources via an unexpected path. That path was likely not to be protected by the same security constraints as the expected path, allowing those security constraints to be bypassed.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.7, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.41, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.105.
The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are 
known to be affected: 8.5.0 through 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions 
may also be affected.


Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.8, 10.1.42 or 9.0.106, which fix the issue.

## CVE-2025-48384
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

## CVE-2025-47917
 Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).

## CVE-2025-47812
 In Wing FTP Server before 7.4.4. the user and admin web interfaces mishandle '\0' bytes, ultimately allowing injection of arbitrary Lua code into user session files. This can be used to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the FTP service (root or SYSTEM by default). This is thus a remote code execution vulnerability that guarantees a total server compromise. This is also exploitable via anonymous FTP accounts.

## CVE-2025-46819
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 8.2.1 and below allow an authenticated user to use a specially crafted LUA script to read out-of-bound data or crash the server and subsequent denial of service. The problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting. This issue is fixed in version 8.2.2. To workaround this issue without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to block a script by restricting both the EVAL and FUNCTION command families.

## CVE-2025-46721
 nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).

xfrm: xfrm_alloc_spi shouldn't use 0 as SPI

x-id.spi == 0 means "no SPI assigned", but since commit
94f39804d891 ("xfrm: Duplicate SPI Handling"), we now create states
and add them to the byspi list with this value.

__xfrm_state_delete doesn't remove those states from the byspi list,
since they shouldn't be there, and this shows up as a UAF the next
time we go through the byspi list.

concurrent writes may create inconsistencies in the internal
socket state.

Disallow this by adding a new ctx-write field that indiciates
exclusive ownership for writing.

## CVE-2025-39946
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: make sure to abort the stream if headers are bogus

Normally we wait for the socket to buffer up the whole record
before we service it. If the socket has a tiny buffer, however,
we read out the data sooner, to prevent connection stalls.
Make sure that we abort the connection when we find out late
that the record is actually invalid. Retrying the parsing is
fine in itself but since we copy some more data each time
before we parse we can overflow the allocated skb space.

Constructing a scenario in which we're under pressure without
enough data in the socket to parse the length upfront is quite
hard. syzbot figured out a way to do this by serving us the header
in small OOB sends, and then filling in the recvbuf with a large
normal send.

Make sure that tls_rx_msg_size() aborts strp, if we reach
an invalid record there's really no way to recover.

## CVE-2025-39913
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp_bpf: Call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict() fails to allocate psock-cork.

syzbot reported the splat below. [0]

The repro does the following:

  1. Load a sk_msg prog that calls bpf_msg_cork_bytes(msg, cork_bytes)
  2. Attach the prog to a SOCKMAP
  3. Add a socket to the SOCKMAP
  4. Activate fault injection
  5. Send data less than cork_bytes

At 5., the data is carried over to the next sendmsg() as it is
smaller than the cork_bytes specified by bpf_msg_cork_bytes().

Then, tcp_bpf_send_verdict() tries to allocate psock-cork to hold
the data, but this fails silently due to fault injection + __GFP_NOWARN.

If the allocation fails, we need to revert the sk-sk_forward_alloc
change done by sk_msg_alloc().

Let's call sk_msg_free() when tcp_bpf_send_verdict fails to allocate
psock-cork.

The "*copied" also needs to be updated such that a proper error can
be returned to the caller, sendmsg. It fails to allocate psock-cork.
Nothing has been corked so far, so this patch simply sets "*copied"
to 0.

## CVE-2025-39682
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix handling of zero-length records on the rx_list

Each recvmsg() call must process either
 - only contiguous DATA records (any number of them)
 - one non-DATA record

If the next record has different type than what has already been
processed we break out of the main processing loop. If the record
has already been decrypted (which may be the case for TLS 1.3 where
we don't know type until decryption) we queue the pending record
to the rx_list. Next recvmsg() will pick it up from there.

Queuing the skb to rx_list after zero-copy decrypt is not possible,
since in that case we decrypted directly to the user space buffer,
and we don't have an skb to queue (darg.skb points to the ciphertext
skb for access to metadata like length).

Only data records are allowed zero-copy, and we break the processing
loop after each non-data record. So we should never zero-copy and
then find out that the record type has changed. The corner case
we missed is when the initial record comes from rx_list, and it's
zero length.

## CVE-2025-38089
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.

    (141d34391abbb315d68556b7c67ad97885407547) [1]
    can be bypassed, and a UAF can still occur when HFSC is utilized with
    NETEM.

    The patch only checks the cl-cl_nactive field to determine whether
    it is the first insertion or not [2], but this field is only
    incremented by init_vf [3].

    By using HFSC_RSC (which uses init_ed) [4], it is possible to bypass the
    check and insert the class twice in the eltree.
    Under normal conditions, this would lead to an infinite loop in
    hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].

    However, if TBF is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a
    very low rate,
    it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.
    This behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the
    HFSC eltree and cause a UAF."

To fix both the UAF and the infinite loop, with netem as an hfsc child,
check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree
whenever the HFSC_RSC flag is set.

## CVE-2025-37947
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos

ksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset
(*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).
If *pos was greater than or equal to v_len, this could lead to an
out-of-bounds memory write.

This patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len before
proceeding. If the condition fails, -EINVAL is returned.

## CVE-2025-32965
 xrpl.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript API for interacting with the XRP Ledger in Node.js and the browser. Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.

## CVE-2025-32873
 An issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.21, 5.1 before 5.1.9, and 5.2 before 5.2.1. The django.utils.html.strip_tags() function is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (slow performance) when processing inputs containing large sequences of incomplete HTML tags. The template filter striptags is also vulnerable, because it is built on top of strip_tags().

## CVE-2025-32778
 Web-Check is an all-in-one OSINT tool for analyzing any website. A command injection vulnerability exists in the screenshot API of the Web Check project (Lissy93/web-check). The issue stems from user-controlled input (url) being passed unsanitized into a shell command using exec(), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying host. This could be exploited by sending crafted url parameters to extract files or even establish remote access. The vulnerability has been patched by replacing exec() with execFile(), which avoids using a shell and properly isolates arguments.

## CVE-2025-32444
 vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

## CVE-2025-32434
 PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system.

## CVE-2025-32433
 Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.

## CVE-2025-32421
 Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Versions prior to 14.2.24 and 15.1.6 have a race-condition vulnerability. This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.

## CVE-2025-32407
 Samsung Internet for Galaxy Watch version 5.0.9, available up until Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, does not properly validate TLS certificates, allowing for an attacker to impersonate any and all websites visited by the user. This is a critical misconfiguration in the way the browser validates the identity of the server. It negates the use of HTTPS as a secure channel, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle attacks, stealing sensitive information or modifying incoming and outgoing traffic. NOTE: This vulnerability is in an end-of-life product that is no longer maintained by the vendor.

## CVE-2025-32395
 Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13, the contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser if the dev server is running on Node or Bun. HTTP 1.1 spec (RFC 9112) does not allow # in request-target. Although an attacker can send such a request. For those requests with an invalid request-line (it includes request-target), the spec recommends to reject them with 400 or 301. The same can be said for HTTP 2. On Node and Bun, those requests are not rejected internally and is passed to the user land. For those requests, the value of http.IncomingMessage.url contains #. Vite assumed req.url won't contain # when checking server.fs.deny, allowing those kinds of requests to bypass the check. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) and running the Vite dev server on runtimes that are not Deno (e.g. Node, Bun) are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.2.6, 6.1.5, 6.0.15, 5.4.18, and 4.5.13.

By setting specific headers and parameters in the POST request, it is possible to execute any unauthorized arbitrary code on the server, which will grant the attackers to have the initial access and information disclosure on the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.8.

## CVE-2025-32023
 Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.

## CVE-2025-31161
 CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.4 and 11 before 11.3.1 allows authentication bypass and takeover of the crushadmin account (unless a DMZ proxy instance is used), as exploited in the wild in March and April 2025, aka "Unauthenticated HTTP(S) port access." A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.

## CVE-2025-31137
 React Router is a multi-strategy router for React bridging the gap from React 18 to React 19. There is a vulnerability in Remix/React Router that affects all Remix 2 and React Router 7 consumers using the Express adapter. Basically, this vulnerability allows anyone to spoof the URL used in an incoming Request by putting a URL pathname in the port section of a URL that is part of a Host or X-Forwarded-Host header sent to a Remix/React Router request handler. This issue has been patched and released in Remix 2.16.3 and React Router 7.4.1.

## CVE-2025-31133
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In versions 1.2.7 and below, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.1, 1.4.0-rc.1 and 1.4.0-rc.2 files, runc would not perform sufficient verification that the source of the bind-mount (i.e., the container's /dev/null) was actually a real /dev/null inode when using the container's /dev/null to mask. This exposes two methods of attack:  an arbitrary mount gadget, leading to host information disclosure, host denial of service, container escape, or a bypassing of maskedPaths. This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.

## CVE-2025-30216
 CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a Heap Overflow vulnerability occurs in the `Crypto_TM_ProcessSecurity` function (`crypto_tm.c:1735:8`). When processing the Secondary Header Length of a TM protocol packet, if the Secondary Header Length exceeds the packet's total length, a heap overflow is triggered during the memcpy operation that copies packet data into the dynamically allocated buffer `p_new_dec_frame`. This allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system instability. A patch is available at commit 810fd66d592c883125272fef123c3240db2f170f.

## CVE-2025-30208
 Vite, a provider of frontend development tooling, has a vulnerability in versions prior to 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10. `@fs` denies access to files outside of Vite serving allow list. Adding `?raw??` or `?import&raw??` to the URL bypasses this limitation and returns the file content if it exists. This bypass exists because trailing separators such as `?` are removed in several places, but are not accounted for in query string regexes. The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or `server.host` config option) are affected. Versions 6.2.3, 6.1.2, 6.0.12, 5.4.15, and 4.5.10 fix the issue.

## CVE-2025-30144
 fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to 5.0.6, the fast-jwt library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim structured as ['https://attacker-domain/', 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation, the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore, if the application relies on external libraries like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially, the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array, alongside the legitimate issuer, and bypass the intended security checks. This issue is fixed in 5.0.6.

Starting in version 1.11.4 and prior to versions 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.5, 13.5.9, 14.2.25, and 15.2.3.

## CVE-2025-29775
 xml-crypto is an XML digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. An attacker may be able to exploit a vulnerability in versions prior to 6.0.1, 3.2.1, and 2.1.6 to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms in systems that rely on xml-crypto for verifying signed XML documents. The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify a valid signed XML message in a way that still passes signature verification checks. For example, it could be used to alter critical identity or access control attributes, enabling an attacker to escalate privileges or impersonate another user. Users of versions 6.0.0 and prior should upgrade to version 6.0.1 to receive a fix. Those who are still using v2.x or v3.x should upgrade to patched versions 2.1.6 or 3.2.1, respectively.

However, a flaw in the account creation process allows an attacker to bypass these restrictions via API request manipulation. An attacker with an Admin access can intercept and modify the API request during user creation, altering the parameters to assign the new account to the ExaGrid Security Officers group without the required approval.

## CVE-2025-27817
 A possible arbitrary file read and SSRF vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Client. Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including "sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url" and "sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the "sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url" and "sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. 

Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property ("-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly.

## CVE-2025-27636
 Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through = 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through = 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through = 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.



This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific

headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method

on the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send

the message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component




The attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are

directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests

that are send to the Camel application.




All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

In these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.

In terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: 


  *  camel-activemq
  *  camel-activemq6
  *  camel-amqp
  *  camel-aws2-sqs
  *  camel-azure-servicebus
  *  camel-cxf-rest
  *  camel-cxf-soap
  *  camel-http
  *  camel-jetty
  *  camel-jms
  *  camel-kafka
  *  camel-knative
  *  camel-mail
  *  camel-nats
  *  camel-netty-http
  *  camel-platform-http
  *  camel-rest
  *  camel-sjms
  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq
  *  camel-stomp
  *  camel-tahu
  *  camel-undertow
  *  camel-xmpp






The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with "Camel", "camel", or "org.apache.camel.". 


Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like "cAmel, cAMEL" etc, or in general everything not starting with "Camel", "camel" or "org.apache.camel.".

## CVE-2025-27607
 Python JSON Logger is a JSON Formatter for Python Logging. Between 30 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0.

## CVE-2025-27533
 Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ.

During unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections.
This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.

## CVE-2025-27519
 Cognita is a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Framework for building modular, open source applications for production by TrueFoundry. A path traversal issue exists at /v1/internal/upload-to-local-directory which is enabled when the Local env variable is set to true, such as when Cognita is setup using Docker. Because the docker environment sets up the backend uvicorn server with auto reload enabled, when an attacker overwrites the /app/backend/__init__.py file, the file will automatically be reloaded and executed. This allows an attacker to get remote code execution in the context of the Docker container. This vulnerability is fixed in commit a78bd065e05a1b30a53a3386cc02e08c317d2243.

## CVE-2025-27415
 Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.16.0, by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN, it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request, such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route, then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0.

## CVE-2025-27410
 PwnDoc is a penetration test reporting application. Prior to version 1.2.0, the backup restore functionality is vulnerable to path traversal in the TAR entry's name, allowing an attacker to overwrite any file on the system with their content. By overwriting an included `.js` file and restarting the container, this allows for Remote Code Execution as an administrator. The remote code execution occurs because any user with the `backups:create` and `backups:update` (only administrators by default) is able to overwrite any file on the system. Version 1.2.0 fixes the issue.

## CVE-2025-27363
 An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.

## CVE-2025-26865
 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine vulnerability in Apache OFBiz.

This issue affects Apache OFBiz: from 18.12.17 before 18.12.18.  

It's a regression between 18.12.17 and 18.12.18.

## CVE-2025-26625
 Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. In Git LFS versions 0.5.2 through 3.7.0, when populating a Git repository's working tree with the contents of Git LFS objects, certain Git LFS commands may write to files visible outside the current Git working tree if symbolic or hard links exist which collide with the paths of files tracked by Git LFS. The git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands do not check for symbolic links before writing to files in the working tree, allowing an attacker to craft a repository containing symbolic or hard links that cause Git LFS to write to arbitrary file system locations accessible to the user running these commands. As well, when the git lfs checkout and git lfs pull commands are run in a bare repository, they could write to files visible outside the repository. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.7.1. As a workaround, support for symlinks in Git may be disabled by setting the core.symlinks configuration option to false, after which further clones and fetches will not create symbolic links. However, any symbolic or hard links in existing repositories will still provide the opportunity for Git LFS to write to their targets.

## CVE-2025-26466
 A flaw was found in the OpenSSH package. For each ping packet the SSH server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack.

## CVE-2025-26465
 A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. A machine-in-the-middle attack can be performed by a malicious machine impersonating a legit server. This issue occurs due to how OpenSSH mishandles error codes in specific conditions when verifying the host key. For an attack to be considered successful, the attacker needs to manage to exhaust the client's memory resource first, turning the attack complexity high.

## CVE-2025-26326
 A vulnerability was identified in the NVDA Remote (version 2.6.4) and Tele NVDA Remote (version 2025.3.3) remote connection add-ons, which allows an attacker to obtain total control of the remote system by guessing a weak password. The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security.

## CVE-2025-26199
 CloudClassroom-PHP-Project v1.0 is affected by an insecure credential transmission vulnerability. The application transmits passwords over unencrypted HTTP during the login process, exposing sensitive credentials to potential interception by network-based attackers. A remote attacker with access to the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi or compromised router) can capture login credentials via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) techniques. If the attacker subsequently uses the credentials to log in and exploit administrative functions (e.g., file upload), this may lead to remote code execution depending on the environment.

## CVE-2025-25612
 FS Inc S3150-8T2F prior to version S3150-8T2F_2.2.0D_135103 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in the Time Range Configuration functionality of the administration interface. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the "Time Range Name" field, which is improperly sanitized. When this input is saved, it is later executed in the browser of any user accessing the affected page, including administrators, resulting in arbitrary script execution in the user's browser.

## CVE-2025-25461
 A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in SeedDMS 6.0.29. A user or rogue admin with the "Add Category" permission can inject a malicious XSS payload into the category name field. When a document is subsequently associated with this category, the payload is stored on the server and rendered without proper sanitization or output encoding. This results in the XSS payload executing in the browser of any user who views the document.

## CVE-2025-25296
 Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it is only set in report-only mode, making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts, potentially allowing theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.

## CVE-2025-25063
 An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3. It does not sufficiently validate uploaded SVG images to ensure they do not contain potentially dangerous SVG tags. SVG images can contain clickable links and executable scripting, and using a crafted SVG, it is possible to execute scripting in the browser when an SVG image is viewed. This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing to be able to upload SVG images, and that Backdrop embeds all uploaded SVG images within &lt;img&gt; tags, which prevents scripting from executing. The SVG must be viewed directly by its URL in order to run any embedded scripting.

 An XSS issue was discovered in Backdrop CMS 1.28.x before 1.28.5 and 1.29.x before 1.29.3. It doesn't sufficiently isolate long text content when the CKEditor 5 rich text editor is used. This allows a potential attacker to craft specialized HTML and JavaScript that may be executed when an administrator attempts to edit a piece of content. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the ability to create long text content (such as through the node or comment forms) and an administrator must edit (not view) the content that contains the malicious content. This problem only exists when using the CKEditor 5 module.

## CVE-2025-24893
 XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Any guest can perform arbitrary remote code execution through a request to `SolrSearch`. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. To reproduce on an instance, without being logged in, go to `host/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch?media=rss&text=%7D%7D%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3Dfalse%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28"Hello%20from"%20%2B%20"%20search%20text%3A"%20%2B%20%2823%20%2B%2019%29%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync%7D%7D%20`. If there is an output, and the title of the RSS feed contains `Hello from search text:42`, then the instance is vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.11, 16.4.1 and 16.5.0RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may edit `Main.SolrSearchMacros` in `SolrSearchMacros.xml` on line 955 to match the `rawResponse` macro in `macros.vm#L2824` with a content type of `application/xml`, instead of simply outputting the content of the feed.

## CVE-2025-24813
 Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to Remote Code Execution and/or Information disclosure and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled Default Servlet in Apache Tomcat.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98.
The following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are 
known to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions 
may also be affected.


If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:
- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads
- attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded
- the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT

If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution:
- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)
- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)
- application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the default storage location
- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.

## CVE-2025-24016
 Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. Starting in version 4.4.0 and prior to version 4.9.1, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows for remote code execution on Wazuh servers. DistributedAPI parameters are a serialized as JSON and deserialized using `as_wazuh_object` (in `framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py`). If an attacker manages to inject an unsanitized dictionary in DAPI request/response, they can forge an unhandled exception (`__unhandled_exc__`) to evaluate arbitrary python code. The vulnerability can be triggered by anybody with API access (compromised dashboard or Wazuh servers in the cluster) or, in certain configurations, even by a compromised agent. Version 4.9.1 contains a fix.

## CVE-2025-23040
 GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

## CVE-2025-22828
 CloudStack users can add and read comments (annotations) on resources they are authorised to access. 

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.


CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure.

## CVE-2025-22620
 gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust. Prior to 0.17.0, gix-worktree-state specifies 0777 permissions when checking out executable files, intending that the umask will restrict them appropriately. But one of the strategies it uses to set permissions is not subject to the umask. This causes files in a repository to be world-writable in some situations. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.17.0.

## CVE-2025-21756
 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Keep the binding until socket destruction

Preserve sockets bindings; this includes both resulting from an explicit
bind() and those implicitly bound through autobind during connect().

Prevents socket unbinding during a transport reassignment, which fixes a
use-after-free:

    1. vsock_create() (refcnt=1) calls vsock_insert_unbound() (refcnt=2)
    2. transport-release() calls vsock_remove_bound() without checking if
       sk was bound and moved to bound list (refcnt=1)
    3. vsock_bind() assumes sk is in unbound list and before
       __vsock_insert_bound(vsock_bound_sockets()) calls
       __vsock_remove_bound() which does:
           list_del_init(&vsk-bound_table); // nop
           sock_put(&vsk-sk);               // refcnt=0

## CVE-2025-12539
 The TNC Toolbox: Web Performance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to the plugin storing cPanel API credentials (hostname, username, and API key) in files within the web-accessible wp-content directory without adequate protection in the "Tnc_Wp_Toolbox_Settings::save_settings" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve these credentials and use them to interact with the cPanel API, which can lead to arbitrary file uploads, remote code execution, and full compromise of the hosting environment.

The user is also not notified that SMS data is being accessed. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure and could effectively break the security provided by SMS-based Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) checks. 

The root cause is a combination of missing permissions for write operations in several content providers (com.android.providers.telephony.PushMessageProvider, com.android.providers.telephony.PushShopProvider, com.android.providers.telephony.ServiceNumberProvider), and a blind SQL injection in the update method of those providers.

## CVE-2025-8671
 A mismatch caused by client-triggered server-sent stream resets between HTTP/2 specifications and the internal architectures of some HTTP/2 implementations may result in excessive server resource consumption leading to denial-of-service (DoS).  By opening streams and then rapidly triggering the server to reset them—using malformed frames or flow control errors—an attacker can exploit incorrect stream accounting. Streams reset by the server are considered closed at the protocol level, even though backend processing continues. This allows a client to cause the server to handle an unbounded number of concurrent streams on a single connection. This CVE will be updated as affected product details are released.

## CVE-2025-8625
 The Copypress Rest API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via copyreap_handle_image() Function in versions 1.1 to 1.2.

## CVE-2025-8081
 The Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read in all versions up to, and including, 3.30.2 via the Import_Images::import() function due to insufficient controls on the filename specified.

## CVE-2025-8067
 A flaw was found in the Udisks daemon, where it allows unprivileged users to create loop devices using the D-BUS system. This is achieved via the loop device handler, which handles requests sent through the D-BUS interface. As two of the parameters of this handle, it receives the file descriptor list and index specifying the file where the loop device should be backed. The function itself validates the index value to ensure it isn't bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it fails to validate the lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be a negative value. Under these circumstances, an attacker can cause the UDisks daemon to crash or perform a local privilege escalation by gaining access to files owned by privileged users.

## CVE-2025-6019
 A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally, the "allow_active" setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an "allow_active" user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host. Normally, udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags like nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However, a local attacker can create a specially crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root shell, then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts their malicious filesystem with root privileges, allowing them to execute their SUID-root shell and gain complete control of the system.

## CVE-2025-6018
 A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations.

## CVE-2025-5054
 Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.




When handling a crash, the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`, which detects if the crashing process resided in a container, was being called before `consistency_checks`, which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this, if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one, apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container, potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally, given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone, crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd, or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e., if dump mode == 1).

## CVE-2025-5025
 libcurl supports *pinning* of the server certificate public key for HTTPS transfers. Due to an omission, this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3, when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL, failing to specify that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.

## CVE-2025-4123
 A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Grafana caused by combining a client path traversal and open redirect. This allows attackers to redirect users to a website that hosts a frontend plugin that will execute arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability does not require editor permissions and if anonymous access is enabled, the XSS will work. If the Grafana Image Renderer plugin is installed, it is possible to exploit the open redirect to achieve a full read SSRF.

The default Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in Grafana will block the XSS though the `connect-src` directive.

## CVE-2025-3102
 The SureTriggers: All-in-One Automation Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an authentication bypass leading to administrative account creation due to a missing empty value check on the 'secret_key' value in the 'autheticate_user' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.78. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create administrator accounts on the target website when the plugin is installed and activated but not configured with an API key.

## CVE-2025-3048
 After completing a build with AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) which include symlinks, the content of those symlinks are copied to the cache of the local workspace as regular files or directories. As a result, a user who does not have access to those symlinks outside of the Docker container would now have access via the local workspace.

Users should upgrade to version 1.134.0 and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. After upgrading, users must re-build their applications using the sam build --use-container to update the symlinks.

## CVE-2025-1461
 Improper neutralization of the value of the 'eventMoreText' property of the 'VCalendar' component in Vuetify allows unsanitized HTML to be inserted into the page. This can lead to a  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss  attack. The vulnerability occurs because the default Vuetify translator will return the translation key as the translation, if it can't find an actual translation.

This issue affects Vuetify versions greater than or equal to 2.0.0 and less than 3.0.0.

Note:
Version 2.x of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue. For more information see  here https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/about/eol/ .

## CVE-2025-1094
 Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions PQescapeLiteral(), PQescapeIdentifier(), PQescapeString(), and PQescapeStringConn() allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns.  Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.  Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve SQL injection when client_encoding is BIG5 and server_encoding is one of EUC_TW or MULE_INTERNAL.  Versions before PostgreSQL 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19 are affected.

## CVE-2025-1055
 A vulnerability in the K7RKScan.sys driver, part of the K7 Security Anti-Malware suite, allows a local low-privilege user to send crafted IOCTL requests to terminate a wide range of processes running with administrative or system-level privileges, with the exception of those inherently protected by the operating system. This flaw stems from missing access control in the driver's IOCTL handler, enabling unprivileged users to perform privileged actions in kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical services or privileged applications.

## CVE-2025-0133
 A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GlobalProtect™ gateway and portal features of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal user's browser when they click on a specially crafted link. The primary risk is phishing attacks that can lead to credential theft—particularly if you enabled Clientless VPN.

There is no availability impact to GlobalProtect features or GlobalProtect users. Attackers cannot use this vulnerability to tamper with or modify contents or configurations of the GlobalProtect portal or gateways. The integrity impact of this vulnerability is limited to enabling an attacker to create phishing and credential-stealing links that appear to be hosted on the GlobalProtect portal.



For GlobalProtect users with Clientless VPN enabled, there is a limited impact on confidentiality due to inherent risks of Clientless VPN that facilitate credential theft. You can read more about this risk in the informational bulletin  PAN-SA-2025-0005 https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005   https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005 . There is no impact to confidentiality for GlobalProtect users if you did not enable (or you disable) Clientless VPN.

## CVE-2025-0108
 An authentication bypass in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management web interface to bypass the authentication otherwise required by the PAN-OS management web interface and invoke certain PHP scripts. While invoking these PHP scripts does not enable remote code execution, it can negatively impact integrity and confidentiality of PAN-OS.

You can greatly reduce the risk of this issue by restricting access to the management web interface to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommended  best practices deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

This issue does not affect Cloud NGFW or Prisma Access software.

## CVE-2025-0054
 SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java does not sufficiently handle user input, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The application allows attackers with basic user privileges to store a Javascript payload on the server, which could be later executed in the victim's web browser. With this the attacker might be able to read or modify information associated with the vulnerable web page.
